Sighting distance model for Scweikert et al. 2020 - "Visual Perception of Bioluminescent Organ Variation in Deep-Sea Shrimps and Implications for Conspecific Recognition"

This file calculates the best-case scenario for underwater sighting distance of bioluminescence by Sergestid shrimps. This model assumes no background light and relies on measured and estimated parameters describing the transmission properties of water and visual physiology of these animals.
